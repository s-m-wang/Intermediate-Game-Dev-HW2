# Intermediate-Game-Dev-HW2
Devlog:
For this game, I really wanted to improve on my overall game feel and aesthetics. Even though I had some set backs in regards to this project concerning my health, I still felt like I've improved in making my games have more juice and feel. I also wanted to include more when it came to animating the sprites. I learned how to change sprites based on triggers and I also learned a whole lot about the rigidbody system. Overall, I think this project changed my perspective a little bit on the Unity Engine. I think I've met my goals pretty well, and I think that this game is definitely an improvement compared to my last one. One of my other goals was that I wanted to make the game feel complete and polished, which I know is a bit difficult, but I think it's an improvement from the original prototype and my first game.
